# Meeting on Nov 12

## Things done:
* Decided on games Minesweeper + 2048

## Things to do:
* Ilan: Board (Model) for 2048
* Max: Grid (View) for 2048
* Ethan + Steven: Minesweeper
* Grace: Floating between both games/refactoring code; Mostly Minesweeper

## Minutes
* Discussing which games to do
* Deciding grid-like games, which would make use of MovementController, GridView classes
* 2048 chosen as first game
* Minesweeper chosen as second game
* Who does which game?
* Ethan and Steven for Minesweeper; Ilan and Max for 2048
* Design pattern for games?
* Since both games are grid-like, make use of MovementController and GestureDetectGridView classes
* Implements MVC Design pattern:
    * MovementController: control
    * GestureDetectGridView: view
    * Board/Game/GameActivity classes: model
* Decided on this because it is easiest to test
    * since we only need to test control class
