# Meeting on Nov 19

## Things done:
* Working on parts of the projects

## Things to do:
* Minesweeper: Board generation, method move
* 2048: Implement undo's
* Implement itertaor design pattern for both games

## Minutes
* Looking at Phase2 criteria to see what else we needed to implement
* Need to decide which games would have undo and auto-save
    * Minesweeper and 2048 can both have autosave
    * How to do unlimited undos for 2048?
        * can't save previous moves in a list because combined tiles will not be "un-combined"
        * instead, save a list of boards
    * It doesn't make sense for Minesweeper to have an undo function
* Also decided that Minesweeper and 2048 would implement iterator design pattern as well
    * Board class would implement Iterable and add an iterator subclass
    * Decided to do this because need to iterate through the tiles/boxes in a board.
* For the rest of the meeting, started coding in individual groups
