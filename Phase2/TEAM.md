# Communication Tools:
* Messenger or through pigeon mail

# Team Contract:
* I will get my allotted work done on time.
* I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
* Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting, I will notify my team immediately.
* The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
* I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
* If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.

# Carrying out work:
* Discuss whether you will do the work individually or in pairs. (Pairs has a lot of advantages â€” for example, one person can be typing and the other can be looking up documentation, and you can discuss design issues as the arise.)

* Each meeting, there should be a designated note taker who is responsible for sharing the notes. These notes should include all decisions made during the meeting, such as who will be responsible for which tasks, and the order in which the tasks need to be done. You must use a Markdown file for each meeting and push it to the repository.
